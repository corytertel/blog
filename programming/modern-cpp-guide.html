	<h3>NEVER use any C functions.</h3>
	<p>The C functions exist for backwards compatibility and that is it. You should never use them. They are not safe. They are equipped to deal with errors by returning a status int, however this is hardly informational and can cause your program to misinterpret what is an error and what is not. Not to mention that the C functions are highly pointer driven, which can cause memory leaks, segfaults, and many more disastrous errors. C functions are also highly mutable, which is just bad program design.</p>
	<p>For every C function that exists, there exists a corresponding C++ function that has the same behavior. However, the C++ function is much safer due to it handling errors through exceptions and the types that are accepted/returned are much more meaningful to the programmer.</p>
	<p>Example: use the C++ "stoi" over the C "atoi" for converting a string to an int.</p>
