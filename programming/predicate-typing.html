    <p>Recently I came up with an idea for an improved type system. I call it predicate typing. I can guarentee you that I am absolutely not the first person to come up with an idea like this. I actually imagine that many programmers think about code this way when they first start out. At least I did.</p>

    <p>After forming the idea I began to look around for something similar and found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_dispatch">predicate dispatch</a>, which seems very familiar. However, as of right now I'm not fully convinced that it is <i>exactly</i> the same.</p>

    <h3>So, what is predicate typing?</h3>






    It is no more restriction than anything that we naturally put on stuff.
