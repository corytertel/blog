    These kinds of things distract from the computation that you are trying to produce. They add mental overhead to the problem. Instead of just solving the problem you now need to worry about something else. Something is interfering with your ability to directly solve the problem. That is the problem with languages like C and Rust: they are not direct with problem solving logic. On the other hand there exist languages like APL which get down to solving the problem directly because the flow of bits is abstracted away, but now you loose fine grain control over your program.

    Rust interferes with the programmer's ability to solve problems.
