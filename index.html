      <p>Hello. Welcome to my site. This is a place for me to express my thoughts, showcase what I'm working on, and ramble about things. Many of my ideas may not be fully thought through or complete. I write here when I'm thinking about something.</p>
      <p>I am currently a student at Arizona State University.</p>
