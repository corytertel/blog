    So many people ask me why I use Emacs, so I have decided to compose a full list of reasons as to why I personally do.

    <ul>
      <li>It's fun.</li>
      <li>It's customizable to myself in a way that no other tool that I have found can.
	Yes it is more customizable that neovim. Neovim locks you into the vim-style of editing and it is terminal only. Not to mention that it has a much bigger library of things to pull from by default (it has a web browser for crying out loud). Now, very arguably this is unnecessary bloat but because 1. it is written in lisp and 2. emacs is all lazy loaded, the modules that you don't use will not even be in the code base until required (emacs lisp has an amazing way to do lazy loading that makes this possible.).</li>
      <li>I can do everything in it without context switching between many different applications. And for the applications that I do need to switch to, like Firefox and Discord, I have setup my system and emacs config in such a way that there is as little context switching and friction as possible. (This is why I use full CUA binds in Emacs.)</li>
      <li>The Emacs experience itself is very frictionless. I can do what I want without mental overhead or application frusteration. There is as little separation between my wants and what I get as possible.</li>
    </ul>
