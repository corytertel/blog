    I went to my favorite website today to practice typing, <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">keybr</a>. I recently switched to Dvorak two months ago and needed more practice because my typing speed is still lacking at around 40-50 wpm. This is hardly the first time I've switched layouts though. In the past I've used Qwerty (obviously) to my own custom "Emacs" Dvorak to BEAKL (which is the best layout ever) to Minimak and then to Dvorak where I am now.

    When I arrived to this website, which I often use, I was very agitated. The site was now plastered with ads. Previously I had my own gripes with the site. I found it hard to use for newcomers, it progressed you at weird points, and there was a complete lack of customizability. I only used the tool because I had found nothing better (and I'm sure there is, but I just haven't found it).

    So today I'm going to make my own typing practice application. Shouldn't be too difficult. Although I do need to complete my scheme library first.
