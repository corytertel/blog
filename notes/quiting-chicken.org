This is how I quit jerking the chicken.

1. Remove all sources of stimulation.
You don't have to quit just yet. Just remove sources of stimulation that make you want to.

2. Do everything from memory.
This makes stimulation come from yourself. This is the first step to getting your life back. Again, you don't have to ease up just yet. Just when you do it, make sure to do it all from imagination.







1. Remove all sources of stimulation.
This puts control over your masturbation back into your hands. Doing this will get you in the habit of only masturbating when you're naturally horny. Nothing will coerce you into masturbating. This will get you to not look at porn when you shouldn't. In this step you don't have to quit porn or masturbating yet. Just get comfortable only doing horny stuff when you're already horny. Stop making yourself horny. Give yourself control.

2. Stop masturbating to porn.
You don't have to stop masturbating at all. Just stop jacking it to porn. This will rid of PIED (porn induced erectile dysfunction) and teach your body to stop relying on porn for pleasure. This will stop your brain's psycological dependence on porn.

3. Entertain yourself with other things rather than jacking off.
This will teach your body that other things are more important than jacking. Over time you will masturbate less and you will start becoming in control of your life.
