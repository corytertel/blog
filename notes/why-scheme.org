Everything is composable.

This means that it's very easy to swap out one part of the algorithm for another quickly and without hurting any additional code.

It also allows for you to completely change how something works (some abstraction like a function) behind the scenes without effecting anything else.



Yes you can do this in C++ or Java, but no one does and this type of development is not encouraged.






Easy refactorization due to abstractions allows you to write algorithms very quickly and then optimize and refactor later without damaging any current code.
