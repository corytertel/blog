Everything is done by a computer.
What do computers do? Have bugs. Fail. Get exploited. Stop working.
What do batteries do? Die.


The doorhandles are controlled by a computer. They are not functional. They are purely aesthetic.
Snow or ice? They stop working.
Battery dies? They stop working.
Need to easily enter the car? Nope.


No gauge cluster.
Hard to see speed limit.
Hard to control air conditioning.
Hard to control windshield wipers. SAFETY HAZARD.
All in the name of "clean aesthetic".


They have a proprietary charger.
You never own your car.
They can take control of your car.
They can ban you from super chargers for speaking out.


Riding in the backseat is nauseating.
It's like riding in the back of a school bus.
