1. Remove all ambiguity from the code.

Even if the code becomes verbose, ambiguous code is the hardest to understand which makes it unreadable from the start.

2. Decrease the character count

Once all ambiguity is removed, remove as much symbols as you can from the code. But this cannot come at the expense of ambiguity.

Example:
~1 + 2 * 3~ vs ~1 + (2 * 3)~

Here we don't know whether the order of operations is mathematical or left to right. So, even though it adds characters, we add parenthesis to remove that confusion.
