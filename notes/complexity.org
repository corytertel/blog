(The definition of) complexity is in the eye of the beholder.

Some people may think that an abstraction introduces unneeded complexity, thus making a program worse. Others will think that the same abstraction makes their life much easier. And it's obvious that writing a python script is much simpler than writing the equivalent in assembly. So where is the line drawn?
