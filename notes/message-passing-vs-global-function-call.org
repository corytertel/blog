Is message passing just the same as a generic, universal function call?

No, because message passing has a different implementation for every object it calls itself onto.

How do theses two relate? Can they coexist?



Methods that clearly operate on an object are "message functions".
i.e. ~ref~, ~tail~, ~append~

What about functions that don't operate on a specific object?
Actually, those don't exist.
Even ~map~ does, just the arg order is different.

And macros/special forms fit into it because again, they are just different syntax.


Is ~map~ just a multi-object message?

~map~ is control flow. It doesn't operate on a specifc object. Or does it?
