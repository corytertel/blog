Architecture should be hands off enough in order for you to solve a problem without it interfering in the natural process of solving the problem. But it should exist enough so that you program is robust, reusable, and easily modifiable and extendable.

The architecture of Java intrudes too much into the natural way of solving programs.

The architecture should be setup in such a way that you can easily accomplish what you your task, refactor and change existing code completely, and it will guide your code to have a much smaller, more extendable, and more efficient codebase.

Good architecture will reduce the lines of code and the complexity of the program significantly. It will shorten code by taking advantage of patterns, unlike C and APL which just compress the existing code into a terse, cryptic mess which make application maintenance and enhancement frightening. It will actually conquer the problems in the code and solve them.
