* Chapter 3: Inheritance


NO INHERITANCE.
It is possible to achieve everything without any inheritance, whether that be in the form of class
inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, or traits.
You can achieve polymorphism through message dispatching. No inheritance required.
Inheritance over-emphasizes classes. Classes are not more important than messaging.
Inheritance trees can often over-complicate the project instead of accomplishing the task at hand.
Inheritance has no way of semantically forcing a child to resemble a parent in structure, actions,
or usage.
