In general:
If it advertises, don't buy.
If it's a coorperation, don't buy.

Now ofc you can't always support the small local guy. Maybe it's too expensive. Maybe it's too inconvenient. Often times it's just straight up impossible. With oligopolies and monopolies it's impossible to support a brand that does not advertise. In those cases you'll need to do your research and pick the guy who is best for you. A great example is airlines. There are no small companies with airlines because the industry has such a high barrier of entry. But just do what you can. If you make this change in most areas of your consuming, you'll be much happier as you'll have much a higher quality of products.
